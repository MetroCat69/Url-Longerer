## The topic of the development lifecycle

1. I don't want to directly deploy to aws becouse this is a very bad habit
1. Also I can't afford to waist money
1. Tried sam+ dynamo in docker and had hell and over enginriring trying to make lambdaas write to the docker dynamo
1. also I am using cdk so it was suck a pain to make everything 
1. tried deploying the dynamo and running lambda locally and lost money and had to do a lot of configiration and stuff still didn't work
1. cant just deploy every time due to pain+money
1. I am going to choose local stack seems like it will enable me to do stuff locally without spending days doing configiration
