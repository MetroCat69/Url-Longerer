# Welcome to my Url shortner and longerer
aws configure --profile localstack
## requitments

this projects uses npm +type script and aws for infa
to avoid disasters i am using aws local stack to deploy and test locally
you need the folowings:
docker
aws-local
aws-cdk
aws-cdk-local
and this project I create a url shortner
while also trolling and creating a url longerer

this project is based on aws

in otder to run locally you need to install docker + sam
you have the docker-wsl-setup for help

I will not be running locally due to a lot of infra over head to do
rather I will be realing on logging

needs the ability to run debug locally
how tp test lambdas not using unit tests but integration tests?
lets do the following stages
basic url shortner
then add better logging
then add like unit and integration tests
the stage 2 3 ect ect
no users just crud url


run start services then cdk local synth build deploy
